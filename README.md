# Bike Store Express Application

This is a TypeScript-based Express application for managing a Bike Store. It integrates MongoDB using Mongoose to manage products (bikes) and orders. The application includes endpoints for performing CRUD operations on bikes and managing customer orders. Additionally, it provides functionality to calculate total revenue from orders.

## Features

- **Bike Management (CRUD)**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete bike products.
- **Order Management**: Customers can place orders, and the stock will be updated accordingly.
- **Revenue Calculation**: Use MongoDB aggregation to calculate total revenue from all orders.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity using Mongoose schema validation.
